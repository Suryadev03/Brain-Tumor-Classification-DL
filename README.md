# 🧠 Brain Tumor Classification Using Deep Learning

An AI-based medical imaging project that automatically detects and classifies brain tumors from MRI scans using Deep Learning. The system helps in faster and more accurate diagnosis by analyzing MRI images and identifying tumor presence and type, supporting doctors in early treatment planning and decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies Used:

* 🐍 Python

* 🧠 TensorFlow, Keras (Deep Learning)

* 🖼️ OpenCV, PIL (Image Processing)

* 📊 NumPy, Pandas

* 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)

* 📓 Jupyter Notebook / VS Code

This project improves the speed, accuracy, and reliability of brain tumor detection through automated image classification.
